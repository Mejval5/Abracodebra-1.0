# Abracodebra 2.0 - Project Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-29  
**Unity Version:** 6 (6000.0.39f1)

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Vision

2D pixel-art ecosystem rogue-like sandbox where **plants grow from node-graphs**, **animals think and interact**, and the environment responds dynamically. Players genetically engineer plants through visual programming and discover new genetics rogue-like style.

**Inspiration:** Noita + Stardew Valley

### Key Pillars
1. **Living Ecosystem** - Dynamic AI with diet, thoughts, emergent behaviors
2. **Procedural Genetics** - Node-graph plant development with environmental effects
3. **Environmental Interaction** - Dual-grid tiles with tool modifications
4. **Genetic Discovery** - Rogue-like progression through experimentation

## ðŸš€ Development Phases

### âœ… PHASE 1 - FOUNDATION (COMPLETED)
