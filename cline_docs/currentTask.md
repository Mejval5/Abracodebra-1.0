# Current Task - Documentation Setup

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-29  
**Scene Context:** MainScene.unity  
**Task Status:** In Progress

## 🎯 Today's Goal
Set up comprehensive project documentation to enable efficient development and collaboration between human developers and AI assistants.

## 📍 Current Context

### Active Scene Elements
- MainScene.unity (primary development scene)
- SampleScene.unity (testing/prototype scene)

### Key Prefabs/Systems
1. **Node System**
   - NodeDefinition scripts in Editor/
   - Plant node configurations in Scriptable Objects/Nodes Plant/
   - Node effect visualization system

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Animal AI and behavior systems
   - Plant growth mechanics
   - Scent propagation system

3. **Tile System**
   - Dual-grid implementation (com.skner.dualgrid package)
   - Wang tile configurations
   - Ground modification system

## 🔄 Current Status

### In Progress
- Creating essential documentation structure
- Analyzing project architecture
- Setting up development guidelines

### Next Steps
1. Read and analyze:
   - Readme.txt
   - DualgridPackage_user-guide.md
   - Unity_EXTRACTED_scripts_*.txt files
   - Project settings and configurations

2. Create remaining documentation:
   - techStack.md
   - codebaseSummary.md
   - Additional reference files as needed

3. Establish documentation maintenance workflow:
   - Update procedures
   - Change tracking
   - Version control integration

## 🎮 Playtest Notes
- Current build focuses on core mechanics
- Plant growth system operational
- Basic animal AI functioning
- Tool system implemented

## 🐛 Known Issues
- To be documented after codebase analysis
- Will track performance considerations
- Will document edge cases

## 📝 Notes
- Project uses Unity 6 (6000.0.39f1)
- URP pipeline with 2D renderer
- Custom shaders for visual effects
- Node-based architecture for plant genetics
