# Current Task - System Integration & Polish

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-29  
**Scene Context:** MainScene.unity  
**Task Status:** Ready for Development

## üéØ Current Development Focus

The core systems are implemented and functional. Focus is now on integration polish, edge case handling, and preparing for expanded content.

## üìç Current Scene Setup

### MainScene.unity Structure
- **Managers**
  - EcosystemManager (with ScentLibrary reference)
  - TileInteractionManager (with dual-grid mappings)
  - PlantGrowthModifierManager
  - WaveManager (with pause controls)
  - WeatherManager (with time scaling)
  - FloraManager (with visualization toggles)
  - FireflyManager (with line visualization)

- **Player Setup**
  - GardenerPrefab with GardenerController
  - ToolSwitcher component with tool definitions
  - PlayerTileInteractor for input handling

- **Tile System**
  - Dual-grid tilemaps (Grass, Dirt, DirtWet, Water)
  - TileDefinition mappings with auto-reversion
  - Rule tiles with proper sorting order

- **UI Systems**
  - NodeEditorGridController (Tab to toggle)
  - Input handling for node editor
  - Tool switching UI integration

## üîÑ System Status Overview

### ‚úÖ **Fully Functional Systems**
1. **Plant Growth System**
   - Time-based growth with tile modifiers
   - Node-graph execution (passive + active effects)
   - Visual cell spawning with proper cleanup
   - Poop fertilizer absorption and leaf regrowth

2. **Animal AI Ecosystem**
   - Complex diet-based food seeking
   - Thought bubble system
   - Poop production and lifecycle
   - Speed modifier zones
   - Wave-based spawning

3. **Node Editor**
   - Grid-based UI with drag-and-drop
   - Effect configuration with ScentDefinition refs
   - Auto-numbered node creation
   - Library management with initial nodes

4. **Tool System**
   - Limited-use tools with refill mechanics
   - Tile transformation rules
   - Plant placement with validation
   - Speed modifier integration

5. **Visual Effects**
   - Plant shadows with distance fading
   - Dynamic outlines with cell tracking
   - Water reflections with masking
   - Firefly attraction visualization
   - Day/night post-processing

### üîÑ **Integration Areas Needing Attention**

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Large plant populations (100+ plants)
   - Animal AI scaling (50+ animals)
   - Visual effect batching
   - Memory management for destroyed objects

2. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Node graph validation edge cases
   - Plant cell destruction race conditions
   - Tool refill timing issues
   - Animal AI stuck states

3. **User Experience Polish**
   - Tool feedback improvements
   - Node editor UX refinements
   - Visual effect transitions
   - Error state handling

## üéÆ Current Gameplay Loop Status

### Working Flow
1. **Plant Design** - Tab opens node editor, drag nodes, configure effects
2. **Plant Creation** - Switch to SeedPouch (Q/E), click valid tiles
3. **Growth Observation** - Plants grow based on tile modifiers and weather
4. **Ecosystem Interaction** - Animals spawn, seek food, produce fertilizer
5. **Tool Usage** - Modify environment with Hoe (dirt), WateringCan (wet dirt)
6. **Cycle Progression** - Day/night affects photosynthesis and spawning

### Known Pain Points
- Plant placement sometimes feels imprecise due to randomization
- Tool usage feedback could be more immediate
- Node editor can be overwhelming for new users
- Animal pathfinding occasionally gets stuck near edges

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Development Priorities

### High Priority (Current Session Focus)
1. **Performance Profiling**
   - Identify bottlenecks in plant/animal updates
   - Optimize visual effect systems
   - Memory leak detection for destroyed objects

2. **Edge Case Fixes**
   - Plant cell destruction race conditions
   - Animal AI boundary handling
   - Tool state synchronization

3. **User Feedback Systems**
   - Tool usage visual/audio feedback
   - Plant growth state indicators
   - System status debugging tools

### Medium Priority (Next Sessions)
1. **Content Expansion**
   - Additional node effect types
   - New tool types and interactions
   - More animal species and behaviors

2. **Save/Load System**
   - NodeGraph serialization
   - World state persistence
   - Player progress tracking

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Plant cross-breeding mechanics
   - Resource management systems
   - Achievement/progression framework

## üß™ Testing Focus Areas

### Critical Test Cases
1. **Plant Growth Lifecycle**
   - Spawn ‚Üí Growth ‚Üí Maturity ‚Üí Death/Removal
   - Node effect execution order
   - Visual effect synchronization

2. **Animal AI Behavior**
   - Food seeking and consumption
   - Thought pattern triggers
   - Population balance

3. **Tool Interactions**
   - Usage limits and refills
   - Tile transformation chains
   - Plant placement validation

### Performance Benchmarks
- 50+ animals with smooth 60 FPS
- 100+ plants with growth effects
- Complex node graphs (8+ nodes)
- Simultaneous visual effects

## üêõ Known Issues Tracking

### High Priority Bugs
- None currently identified (need profiling session)

### Medium Priority Issues
- Plant placement randomization sometimes places outside tile bounds
- Animal AI occasionally clusters in corners
- Node editor dropdown can be difficult to use on small screens

### Low Priority Polish
- Visual effect transitions could be smoother
- Tool icons could be more distinctive
- Node effect descriptions need improvement

## üìù Development Session Goals

### Today's Session
1. Run comprehensive performance profiling
2. Fix any critical race conditions
3. Improve tool usage feedback
4. Test large population scenarios

### Next Session Goals
1. Implement save/load foundation
2. Add new node effect types
