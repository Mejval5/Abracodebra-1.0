# User Guide

This article will show you how you can use this library and detail its features.

I recommend learning about how the dual grid works conceptually before attempting to use it. I will be describing examples and also _teaching_ how the system works.

## Introduction

Before using a dual grid, we need a tilesheet. There are several tilesheet formats but for this dual grid a standard dual grid 16x tileset is necessary. It looks something like this:

As you can see in the white lines, it's divided in 16 tiles, but not how standard tilesets are divided. 

Each tile represents a unique configuration of corners, which is intended to mimic a half-unit offset of the data grid. 

Consider the following tiles from the above example tilesheet.


These tiles can be arranged to visually represent the 4 corners of a 1x1 square tile.


If we actually join the tiles with some visual guidelines for the data tile, it will look something like this.


In the above screenshot, we have some visual guidelines: 
- ðŸŸ¢ The green square that represent a __Data Tile__. 
- ðŸŸ¡ The 4 yellow squares represent __Render Tiles__.
- ðŸ”´ The red arrows represent the __data neighbours__ for each __Render Tile__.

We paint a single tile in the __Data Tilemap__ and 4 tiles are used to visually represent it in the __Render Tilemap__. By offsetting the __Render Tilemap__ by half a unit, we get this nice overlap, where each Render tile represents the intersection of 4 Data tiles.

With this approach, we can make any shape we want.

However, Unity doesn't have a built-in way to do this, let alone something that is compatible with their own Tilemap components. This is where this library comes in.

## The Dual Grid Rule Tile

[Rule Tiles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@4.1/manual/RuleTile.html) in Unity are _smart tiles_. They automatically update depending on their neighbors with rules defined by the user. 

Each Rule Tile contains a list of tiling rules that maps the tile's neighbor configuration to a specific sprite. Then, Unity's internal tilemap code checks for updates in each tilemap and updates any required tile to the correct sprite, defined by these tiling rules.


Dual Grid Rule Tiles are very similar, but they are made to work with the dual grid tilemap. 

Instead of each tiling rule defining their neighbors __in the same tilemap__, they consider the neighbor positions from the __Data Tilemap__.

### Importing the tilesheet

With this library, creating this is automatic, even the tiling rules are filled automatically.

For it to work, you'll need a 16x tileset that looks like this.

Import it into Unity and ensure the Sprite Mode is set to _Multiple_.

Then, open the Sprite Editor and perform an _Grid By Cell Count_ slice, in a 4x4 configuration and make sure to have _Keep Empty Rects_ ticked.

With this, apply the changes and your tilesheet is ready.

Ensure that the names of each split sprite ends with an '_' followed by a number. Do not change these names, otherwise the automatic tiling process will not work as intended.

### Creating the Dual Grid Rule Tile

This package automatically creates the Dual Grid Rule Tile asset. Simply right-click on the ready tilesheet and click Create -> 2D -> Tiles -> Dual Grid Rule Tile. 

If your tilesheet has been correctly prepared, a dialog box should appear.

By clicking yes, the system will automatically populate the tiling rules and output the fully functional asset.

Note: If you have any wrong tiling rules it may happen when the slice operation was not performed __exactly__ as described here.

Make use of the built-in preview to ensure your tilemap is properly configured.

## The Dual Grid Tilemap

Now that we have our Dual Grid Rule Tile created, we can start using it.

To use it, we must use a normal tilemap with a custom module that manipulates Unity's tilemap and transforms it into a dual grid tilemap.

You can create one easily by clicking on GameObject -> 2D Object -> Tilemap -> Dual Grid Tilemap.

A new grid should be added to your scene that contains both __Data Tilemap__ and its respective __Render Tilemap__.

In the newly created _DataTilemap_ object, there's the __Dual Grid Tilemap Module__. Assign your newly created __Dual Grid Rule Tile__ to it.

And now you can paint over the __Data Tilemap__ and magic will take care of the rest! You don't need to have a Tile Palette setup for it to work either.


## Multiple tilemaps

You can have multiple tilemaps for more than one grid. As of yet, __there's no support to have different tilesheets per Data Tilemap__, but I might try to implement this in the future.

To do so, you can share a grid, but __never__ share a __Data Tilemap__.

## Colliders

Unity provides two kind of colliders for Tilemaps:

#### Grid

It transforms each filled cell into a collider, taking the shape of the cell. The Dual Grid Tilemap will place a TilemapCollider2D component in the DataTilemap.

#### Sprite

It uses the selected Sprite as a collider for each cell. In contrast to the Grid collider type, the Dual Grid Tilemap will place a TIlemapCollider2D component in the RenderTilemap instead. This type is particularly useful if any rounded corner tilesets are used.

To prepare the Dual Grid Tilemap to use colliders, we must first set it up in the respective Dual Grid Rule Tile.

### Dual Grid Rule Tile Configuration

Create or open an existing Dual Grid Rule Tile, and in the 'Rule Tile Settings' header, find the Collider field.

### Dual Grid Tilemap Module Configuration

Then, all that's left is to enable the Tilmap Collider in the Dual Grid Tilemap Module.

## GameObjects

Unity allows GameObjects to be associated in a specific Tile which are instantiated when said Tile is placed on a Tilemap. In a standard Rule Tile, it's even possible to set a different GameObject per Tiling Rule. 

This is quite useful if the Tilemap is used to check for collider triggers (hazardous surfaces or ground checks), game logic or many other use cases.

For Dual Grid Rule Tiles, since it makes use of two Tilemaps, both approaches are possible:
- Data Tilemap: single GameObjects for every filled Data Tile
- Render Tilemap: GameObject per specific Tiling Rule

### Examples

Let's take a GameObject prefab that only has a white circle in its center.

And the following Dual Grid Tilemap layout.

#### Data Tilemap Origin

If we set the GameObject to the Data Tile and the origin in the DataTilemap, we'll get the following result.
Every filled Data Tile will have the GameObject set to its center. Note that __it's not possible to set different GameObjects per tile with the Data Tilemap origin__.

#### Render Tilemap Origin

If we use the Render Tilemap as the origin of the GameObject, this is the result.

Now the Circle GameObject is center for each Render Tile, which visually results in each corner of the Data Tilemap being populated with the GameObject.

As explained previously, using the Render Tilemap Origin, we can set different GameObjects depending on what Render Tile has been selected. 

In this practical example, the Dual Grid Rule Tile has been configured so that only the corner Render Tiles have the GameObject set.

Here's how to set it up:

### Dual Grid Rule Tile Configuration

Create or open an existing Dual Grid Rule Tile, and in the 'Rule Tile Settings' header, find the GameObject field.

This will set the GameObject for when the Data Tilemap Origin is used.

Under the Dual Grid Tiling Rules, find the GameObject field for each one.

### Dual Grid Tilemap Module Configuration

Then, all that's left is to select which Game Object Origin to use in the Dual Grid Tilemap Module.
